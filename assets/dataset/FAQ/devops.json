      "question": "What is Continuous Integration (CI)?",
      "ans": "Continuous Integration is a DevOps practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests are triggered upon each code commit, ensuring that integration issues are identified early, and the code remains in a deployable state at all times."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?",
      "ans": "Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Integration. With CD, changes that pass automated testing and meet quality criteria are automatically deployed to production without manual intervention. This enables frequent and reliable releases to end-users."
